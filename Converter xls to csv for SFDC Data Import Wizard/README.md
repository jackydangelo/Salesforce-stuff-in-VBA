# Excel Macro converter_xls_to_csv_for_salesforce
This macro allows you to transform an xls table into a csv file. Each value is enclosed in quotes """ and separated by ";".

The macro was created to transform excel files into tables to be uploaded massively to salesforce crm.
The main file creates the file to give to the Salesforce data import wizard. The extra files are sub or functions added as needed (in the main file there is the comment on which they were inserted).

The file has a .vba extension to make it recognized by the system, just copy the code into your excel to make it work.
